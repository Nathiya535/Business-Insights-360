## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is must. Refer this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.

Key Learnings.
The most helpful measures for senior management are the Gross Margin and Net Profit (Gross Margin - Operational Costs).
Gross Margin and Net Sales are more significant to the sales team than Net Profit since, in most cases, they have little to no control over operating costs.
Understanding the changes in marketing spend over time and how those changes affect revenue and gross margin is crucial for the marketing team.
Forecast Accuracy & Risk (Out of Stock or Excess Inventory) and Net Error & Absolute Error are crucial KPIs for the supply chain team.
One of the most helpful abilities that aids in the creation of insightful visuals is the managing of stakeholder expectations.
Thank you.
